MAPP (MIT Atomistic Parallel Package)
MAPP is a parallel atomistic simulation package written entirely in C++, it is presented in form of a [python](http://www.python.org) package in order to facilitate usage. Some of the main features of MAPP are:

  * Molecular Dynamics (MD)
  * Diffusive Molecular Dynamics ([DMD](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.84.054103)) canonical ensemble
  * DMD isothermoal-isostress ensemble
  * Sophisticated energy minimization (CG and l-BFGS) and line search (brent, golden section and back track) algorithms
  * Parallel Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (pGCMC) for pair and many body potentials such as EAM
