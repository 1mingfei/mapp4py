MAPP is a parallel atomistic simulation package written in C++, and is presented as a Python package in order to facilitate usage. In addition to being able to perform energy minimization and Molecular Dynamics (MD), it is equipped with parallel Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and Diffusive Molecular Dynamics (DMD) [1]_. At the moment the paralleization algortihms are done using standard message passing interface (MPI) library [2]_.
